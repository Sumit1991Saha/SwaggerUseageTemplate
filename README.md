# JAX-RS/Jersey server with OpenAPI

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.
Jersey is used as JAX-RS implementation, `io.swagger:swagger-jersey2-jaxrs` is used to derive the OpenAPI Specification from the annotated code.

To generate the model files, run the following command:-
./gradlew cleanSources openApiGenerate

To run on the jetty server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```
To debug the application on jetty server, run the following:-
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"

Then start jetty using -
mvn jetty:run

You can then view the OpenAPI v2 specification here:

```
http://localhost:8080/samarthgupta437/HRCrud/1.0.0/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!

For example to test the rest API's use the below mentioned URL:-
@POST
http://localhost:8084/SwaggerUseageTemplate/employees (place a post request with proper payload on this URL to create a employee)

Sample employee payload :-
{
    "firstName": "Sumit",
    "lastName": "Saha",
    "designation": "Software Dev",
    "employeeConfiguration": {
        "employeeType": "DEVELOPER",
        "startDate": "01/01/2019",
        "projectName": "sample project"
    }
}

@GET
http://localhost:8084/SwaggerUseageTemplate/employees/1
